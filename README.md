[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crisp-im/crisp-status-local.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/crisp-im/crisp-status-local) [![Dependency Status](https://deps.rs/repo/github/crisp-im/crisp-status-local/status.svg)](https://deps.rs/repo/github/crisp-im/crisp-status-local)

**Crisp Status Local is used to monitor internal hosts and report their status to Crisp Status.**

Crisp Status Local is a daemon that you can use to report internal service health to your Crisp Status-powered status page. It is designed to be used behind a firewall, and to monitor hosts bound to your local loop or LAN network (eg. a MySQL server running on a LAN IP address).

Install Crisp Status Local on a server of yours and configure it with your Crisp Status token; it will then automatically start monitoring all nodes that you configured in Crisp in `local` mode. The `local` mode is similar to `poll` mode, but is used specifically for `crisp-status-local` monitoring.
